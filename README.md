## Problem Statements

### Problem 1: Task Management System
**Objective**: Create a system to manage daily tasks dynamically.

#### Features:
1. **Task Structure**:  
   Each task is represented as an object with:
   - `title` (string): The name of the task.  
   - `status` (string): Either `"Pending"` or `"Completed"`.  
   - `priority` (number): A value between 1 (low) and 5 (high).  

2. **Functions**:  
   - **Add Task**: Add a new task object using an arrow function.  
   - **Filter by Status**: Use `filter()` to list all tasks based on their status.  
   - **Find High Priority Task**: Use `find()` to locate the first task with a priority of `5`.  
   - **Task Titles with Status**: Use `map()` to create a formatted list:  
     `"Task: [Title], Status: [Status]"`.  
   - **Log Details**: Use template literals to log all tasks in a readable format.

### Problem 2: Online Shopping Cart
**Objective**: Develop a simple shopping cart system.

#### Features:
1. **Product Structure**:  
   Each product is represented as an object with:
   - `productName` (string): The name of the product.  
   - `price` (number): The cost of the product.  
   - `quantity` (number): Number of units in the cart.  

2. **Functions**:  
   - **Add Product**: Add a new product to the cart.  
   - **Calculate Total**: Use `reduce()` to compute the total cost of all products in the cart.  
   - **Remove Product**: Use an arrow function to remove a product by name.  
   - **Log Product Details**: Use destructuring to extract product details and log them.  
   - **Cart Summary**: Use template literals to display a summary in the format:  
     `"Product: [Name], Price: $[Price], Quantity: [Quantity]"`.

### Problem 3: Weather Forecast Tracker
**Objective**: Build a tracker to manage weather data for different cities.

#### Features:
1. **City Weather Structure**:  
   Each city's weather is represented as an object with:
   - `cityName` (string): The city's name.  
   - `temperature` (number): Temperature in Celsius.  
   - `condition` (string): Weather condition (e.g., `"Sunny"`, `"Cloudy"`, `"Rainy"`).  

2. **Functions**:  
   - **Add City Weather**: Add a new city weather object.  
   - **Find Hottest City**: Use `find()` to locate the city with the highest temperature.  
   - **Filter by Condition**: Use `filter()` to list cities with a specific condition.  
   - **City Temperature List**: Use `map()` to format the list:  
     `"City: [CityName], Temp: [Temperature]°C"`.  
   - **Log Hottest City**: Use destructuring to log details of the hottest city.  
   - **Weather Summary**: Use template literals to log all cities in the format:  
     `"City: [Name], Temp: [Temp]°C, Condition: [Condition]"`.

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the project directory in a code editor (e.g., VS Code).
3. Open the `index.html` file in a browser or use Node.js to execute the JavaScript file.
4. Interact with the code by calling the provided functions in the browser console or within the script.
5. Review console logs for outputs or summaries generated by the functions.
